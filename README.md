This is a complete build of a miniature rail-stand for use with railroad simulators.

Included in this repo are the source code for both the hardware interface (arduino-type controller) as well as a Daemon used to send UDP data to the train simulator software known as Run8.

Also included is the KiCad project (right now, just a schematic), and links to the OnShape 3D model used to 3D-print the stand itself: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ee68d1fb4ee2b8880d44aae3/w/7c6829b5f97449183b040dd5/e/efcd98333ec3d0d73e2c39b0?renderMode=0&uiState=66354b10b6c61859b259346e
