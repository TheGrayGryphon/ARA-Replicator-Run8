This is a complete build of a miniature rail-stand for use with railroad simulators.

Included in this repo:
1. Arduino IDE project for the hardware interface written found in the *miniRD_fw* directory.
2. Host "daemon" Python code used to send UDP data to the train simulator software known as Run8 (*Main.py* and *Run8.py*) - see *requirements.txt* for library dependencies.
3. KiCad project (right now, just a schematic) found in the *miniRDkicad* directory which details the electronics for the user controls.
4. Finally, some details on the mechanical bits including a layout of the button / lever mapping and links to the OnShape 3D model used to 3D-print the stand itself: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ee68d1fb4ee2b8880d44aae3/w/7c6829b5f97449183b040dd5/e/efcd98333ec3d0d73e2c39b0?renderMode=0&uiState=66354b10b6c61859b259346e
